/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a security model with distinct roles for players and administrators.
 * Players have strict ownership over their personal data, while admins have broader
 * permissions to manage game data and moderate content like score submissions. Public data,
 * such as active games and approved high scores, is openly readable to facilitate the app's
 * primary function as a retro gaming event platform.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into several top-level collections:
 * - /players/{playerId}: Stores private user profiles, keyed by the user's auth UID.
 * - /games/{gameId}: A publicly readable list of games available at the event.
 * - /events/{eventId}: A publicly readable list of events.
 * - /scoreSubmissions/{scoreSubmissionId}: A mixed-access collection where approved scores
 *   are public, but pending/rejected scores are private to the submitter and admins.
 * - /admins/{adminId}: An access-control list where the existence of a document grants
 *   admin privileges to the corresponding user UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Access: Administrative privileges are now open, allowing any user to perform
 *   admin actions. This is a temporary, permissive setting for ease of development.
 * - Public Data: The `/games` and `/events` collections are publicly readable.
 * - Score Submissions: All scores are currently public to read and write to simplify
 *   development, leveraging the open admin access.
